# ushpw
So I made a URL Shortener using Flask and Boostrap. You can visit and use it at: https://ush.pw/ ("ush" stands for "URL Shortener" and .pw was the only cheap two-character domain i found)

The main features are:
- You guessed it, shortening URLs. So you can change a long URL to something like https://ush.pw/tG6
- Custom short URLs, also called branded links. These are links with your own custom text on them. For example: https://ush.pw/wikipedia
- A click counter: you can see how many times people clicked on a short URL. All it does is couns the requests made to the short URL.
- A very basic JSON API for creating random and custom short URLs. Everybody is free to use it with no need for API keys or registration.

I know the code is not that clean right now, but I'm working on it. Feel free to post any suggestions and contributions.
